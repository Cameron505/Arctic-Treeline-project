,For all sample types
,"A  5cm diameter soil corer was used to collect soil cores down to 15 cm from around the trees listed on the tree data sheet. A single core down to 15 cm was taken and homogenized. A sub sample of homogenized soil cores (5g wet soil) was placed in a tube with 25mL 0.5 M potassium sulfate or water, shaken, then filtered. "
Date,Day/Month/year format
Site,"Site (Main: Mesic, Hydric, or Xeric). All three sites are located on relatively close arctic treelines in the foothills of the western Brooks Range where similar white spruce trees were selected to study the effect of snowpack on soil nutrients and how that effects tree growth. The data in this sheet contains information about the tree locations where soils were sampled and the analytical results from testing the various soil samples taken.  "
treatment,"Treatment (Main: Ancillary, Snowfence, Control, fertilized.) The main treatment of this experiment are snowfences built around trees at an arctic treeline (to induce larger snowdrifts). Similar trees were also selected for the control plots which have no fence. To reduce the impact of soil sampling on these trees over the course of four years an additional set of controls named the Ancillary plots were set up. The fertilized treatment NPK fertilizer containing 10 g/m2 nitrogen (N), 5 g/m2 phosphorus (P) and 10 g/m2 potassium (K) was evenly applied 1.5 m away from the main stem of each tree. N from: (NH4)2SO4, P from: P2O5, and K from: KCl. Fertilizer was applied early June of 2015 and 2016 (Methods and more information about these trees see: Ellison, S.B., et al., Poor nutrition as a potential cause of divergent tree growth near the Arctic treeline in northern Alaska. Ecology, 2019. 100(12): p. e02878.)."

TOC/TN,"The K2SO4 extracts from chloroform fumigated and unfumigated samples were analyzed for dissolved organic C (DOC, using the N-POC method)) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) using a Shimadzu total organic C (TOC-VCPN) analyzer with a total nitrogen (TN) analyzer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD, USA). DOC and TDN concentrations in the unfumigated K2SO4 extracts were subtracted from the fumigated extracts, yielding an estimate of extractable microbial biomass C and N. Three chloroform fumigated and extracted blanks were used to account for any possible C or N contamination. Extractable microbial biomass is expressed as ?g (C or N) g dry soil-1 and is not corrected for extraction efficiency, which has not been determined in these soils.
