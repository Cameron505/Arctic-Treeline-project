##   sample summary

<details>
  <summary>click to open</summary>

Soils were collected around trees on treelines in the western brooks range Alaska varying in soil moisture. Three sites were chosen: Tussock tundra (Mesic), Wet Sedge (Hydric), and Dryas-lichen tundra (Xeric). 8 similar trees were chosen per treatment based on their DBH and proximity to the treeline. Snow fences were constructed as a treatment to build larger snow packs around the given trees in winter and compared against a control group where nothing was done besides sampling. In order to reduce impact on these tree-plots 8 Ancillary trees were also chosen based on the same DBH, proximity to treeline parameters and used for seasonal sampling.   
  A previous project conducted at these sites fertilized soils around similar trees. These soils were also sampled to identify long term effects of fertilization. 
  Soils were collected from control and snowfence trees in march and late may/early June (Just after thaw) along with resin strips (Except in 2020). Soil pore water was taken regularly during the growing season (2017-2019). During 2019 collection frequencies reduced due to staffing and were disrupted due to COVID in 2020 with an inability to visit the field sites.

#### PCA by Site:
FTICR revealed large differences in organic matter content based on site, and small variation based on time of year. Mesic contains far more aromatic, condensed aromatic, and unsaturated lignin compounds (Note that it does not have the highest concentrations of phenolics). Site explained ~70% of the variation in FTICR compound diversity, where as the interaction between Site:year explained ~10% of the variation.
